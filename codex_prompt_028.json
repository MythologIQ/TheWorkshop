  "instructions": "You are making The Workshop more approachable for future contributors and extension builders.\n\nGoal for this task:\nProvide clear architecture and extension documentation that explains how Stations, stores, and runtime pieces fit together.\n\nPerform these steps:\n\n1) Architecture overview\n   - Create docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md describing:\n     - High-level module map (runtime, domain, stores, ui, stations).\n     - Data flow from user input -> store -> station -> AI -> store -> UI.\n     - Where safety and creativity boundaries are enforced.\n\n2) Station lifecycle\n   - Create docs/STATION_LIFECYCLE.md that explains:\n     - How a station is defined (types, store usage, route, UI component).\n     - How to add a new Station (step-by-step checklists).\n     - How to integrate with AIProvider and projectStore safely.\n\n3) Extension points\n   - Create docs/EXTENSION_POINTS.md describing sanctioned places to extend the system, such as:\n     - Adding new Stations or sub-panels.\n     - Adding new tutorials.\n     - Adding new themes.\n\n4) Update contributor docs\n   - Update docs/CONTRIBUTING.md or add a separate docs/DEVELOPER_SETUP.md with:\n     - Setup steps (cloning, installing dependencies, running dev server).\n     - Reference to the architecture docs.\n\nKeep these documents high-level but precise enough to avoid guesswork for future maintainers.",
