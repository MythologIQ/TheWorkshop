# The Workshop v1.0.0 Release Notes

## Highlights
- **Replay Station (Time Tunnels):** Children can now save up to ten snapshots per project, inspect each version, and branch or restore after clear confirmation prompts so every path stays safe.
- **Snapshots stay compact:** The stored project state omits bulky runtime metadata, keeps tags, idea context, steps, and reflection snapshots so branching stays fast even on lower-tier hardware.
- **Accessibility and polish:** Status updates live in `aria-live` regions, navigation links expose `aria-current`, and forms/controls respect contrast and sizing goals aligned with the Creativity Boundary so keyboard and screen-reader users stay on track.
- **Docs & release readiness:** Project plan, timeline, and station spec now call out Replay, accessibility work, and the new `check:assets` guard; Release Notes tie the v1 story together.

## Testing
- `npm run build`
- `npm run check:assets`
