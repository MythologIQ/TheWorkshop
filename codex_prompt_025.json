  "summary": "Implement project import/export as .workshop.json files for backup and device transfer.",
  "instructions": "You are implementing project import/export so that kids (and adults) can move their creations between devices or back them up, while preserving safety and simplicity.\n\nGoal for this task:\nProvide a simple export/import flow using JSON files that represent one project, without exposing sensitive data.\n\nPerform these steps:\n\n1) Export format\n   - Define a stable JSON structure for a project export in docs/PROJECT_EXPORT_FORMAT.md.\n   - Include:\n     - A schema version.\n     - Project core fields (id, name, timestamps).\n     - Station slices (idea, build, test, memory, reflect, share, snapshots).\n   - Exclude or anonymize:\n     - Any device-specific or internal-only IDs that are not needed to reconstruct the project meaningfully.\n\n2) Export implementation\n   - Add an exportProject(projectId) helper under app/src/runtime/export/export_project.ts that:\n     - Loads the project.\n     - Converts it to the export format.\n     - Triggers a download of a .workshop.json file (or returns the blob to the caller).\n\n3) Import implementation\n   - Add an importProject(file) helper under app/src/runtime/export/import_project.ts that:\n     - Reads and parses the JSON file.\n     - Validates the schema version and key fields.\n     - Adapts or migrates data if needed.\n     - Creates a new Project entry in projectStore (with a new local ID if appropriate).\n   - Handle errors gracefully and surface a friendly message if the file is invalid.\n\n4) UI integration\n   - Add Import and Export controls in a safe place (for example on the ProjectSelectionPage or in a \"Project tools\" panel).\n   - Make the copy clear:\n     - Export: \"Save a copy of this project to a file\".\n     - Import: \"Open a project file from this device\".\n\n5) Safety considerations\n   - Remind the user that exported files may still contain creative content that they might not want to share widely.\n   - Encourage storing them with a trusted adult when appropriate.\n\nDo not implement cloud sync here; this task is strictly about local file import and export.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "docs/PROJECT_EXPORT_FORMAT.md defines a clear JSON export schema with versioning.",
    "exportProject helper can save a single project into a .workshop.json file.",
    "importProject helper can load a .workshop.json file, validate it, and create a new Project.",
    "UI controls exist to export and import projects from an obvious location.",
    "Errors in import are handled kindly and do not break the app."
