  "instructions": "You are implementing the Memory Station (Stellar Archive) and Reflect Station (Orbiter Bridge).\n\nGoal for this task:\nLet children capture small reflections about their work (wins, lessons, next-time) and see simple patterns across entries.\n\nPerform these steps:\n\n1) Extend Project type with memory and reflect slices\n   - In app/src/domain/project.ts, add:\n     - memory?: {\n         entries: {\n           id: string;\n           createdAt: string;\n           proudOf: string;\n           lesson: string;\n           nextTime: string;\n         }[];\n       }\n     - reflect?: {\n         snapshots: {\n           id: string;\n           createdAt: string;\n           tags: string[];\n           notes: string;\n         }[];\n       }\n   - Keep text lengths limited per docs/CREATIVITY_BOUNDARY_SPEC.md.\n\n2) MemoryStationPage (Stellar Archive)\n   - In app/src/stations/memory/MemoryStationPage.tsx:\n     - Use useProjects() to get selectedProject and updateProject.\n     - Provide three short fields:\n       - \"Something I\u2019m proud of\"\n       - \"Something I learned\"\n       - \"Something I might do next time\"\n     - A single button to save a reflection entry, which appends to memory.entries.\n     - Show a simple timeline list of previous entries with createdAt and proudOf/lesson summaries.\n\n3) ReflectStationPage (Orbiter Bridge)\n   - In app/src/stations/reflect/ReflectStationPage.tsx:\n     - Use useProjects() and data from memory, build, and test slices.\n     - Option 1 (non-AI v1): compute simple patterns locally, such as:\n       - How many entries mention similar words or tags.\n       - Frequency of visits to stations.\n     - Option 2 (AI-assisted): use useAI().callStationModel(\"reflect\", payload) to ask for gentle pattern summaries.\n     - UI should show:\n       - A short, plain language summary of patterns.\n       - Optional tag suggestions (for example: \"brave\", \"patient\", \"curious\").\n       - Tag selection and storing of a reflect.snapshots entry with tags and notes.\n\n4) Boundaries and tone\n   - Ensure text fields and tag counts respect the Creativity Boundary spec.\n   - Do not psychoanalyze or assign heavy labels; keep language about the work, not the child as a person.\n   - If using AI, system prompt must emphasize kindness, non-diagnostic language, and future-oriented suggestions.\n\n5) Integration\n   - Wire both stations into the router and main navigation.\n   - Ensure they behave sensibly if there are no entries yet (empty state messages).\n\nFocus on making these stations feel like a safe place to notice growth, not a grading system.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Project type has memory and reflect slices with compact, bounded structures.",
    "MemoryStationPage.tsx allows adding a reflection entry with proudOf, lesson, and nextTime fields and displays a simple timeline.",
    "ReflectStationPage.tsx surfaces simple patterns from memory/test/build data, either locally or with AI assistance, and can store tagged snapshots.",
    "Text lengths and tag counts are constrained to values consistent with the Creativity Boundary spec.",
    "The overall tone of both stations is supportive, non-diagnostic, and focused on effort and learning."
