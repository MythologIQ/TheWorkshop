  "title": "Add a guided tutorial experience that walks a first-time user through building their first project.",
  "summary": "Implement a mission-style guided flow that overlays hints and progress steps across Stations for a first project.",
  "instructions": "You are adding a guided tutorial system to help kids complete their first project in The Workshop.\n\nGoal for this task:\nImplement a mission-style guided flow that overlays hints and progress steps on top of the existing Stations, without locking the UI down too tightly.\n\nPerform these steps:\n\n1) Tutorial domain model\n   - Create app/src/domain/tutorial.ts defining:\n     - TutorialId type (for example 'first_project_robot_dog').\n     - Step type containing:\n       - id, title, description, targetStationKey, and optional targetElementId or hintPlacement.\n     - TutorialState type with:\n       - activeTutorialId, currentStepIndex, completedAt (optional).\n\n2) Tutorial store\n   - Create app/src/runtime/store/tutorialStore.ts:\n     - Manage active tutorial state and progress.\n     - Save tutorial progress to local storage (per user/device).\n     - Expose methods:\n       - startTutorial(id), nextStep(), prevStep(), completeTutorial(), resetTutorial(id).\n\n3) Tutorial overlay UI\n   - Implement a TutorialOverlay component under app/src/ui/tutorial/ that:\n     - Observes tutorialStore.\n     - Displays current step info: title, description, and what Station the user should visit.\n     - Optionally highlights a target element (if targetElementId is available) or the Station in nav.\n     - Provides Next/Back/Skip/Done controls.\n\n4) First mission: Robot Dog Comic\n   - Define a tutorial configuration for a simple default mission (for example Robot Dog Comic from the Atlas examples):\n     - Steps that move through: Idea \u2192 Build \u2192 Test \u2192 Memory \u2192 Share.\n     - Simple instructions at each step that map to actions the child can realistically take.\n   - Hook this tutorial to a prominent 'Try a Guided Mission' button on the project selection or landing screen.\n\n5) Boundaries and tone\n   - Ensure tutorial hints are short, encouraging, and non-judgmental.\n   - Allow users to exit the tutorial at any time without losing their project data.\n\nDo not create a full mission editor yet. Focus on the data structures, store, overlay, and a single guided path.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "A tutorial domain model exists with TutorialId, Step, and TutorialState types.",
    "tutorialStore manages active tutorial progress and persists it to local storage.",
    "A TutorialOverlay component can show current step info and navigation controls, reacting to tutorialStore.",
    "A 'Robot Dog Comic' style tutorial is available and can guide a user through Stations from project start to share.",
    "Users can exit the tutorial at any time without losing project data."
