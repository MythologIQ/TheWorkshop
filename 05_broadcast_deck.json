It should explain that the station helps package the project into a presentation or similar, and include explicit Safety Contract guidance: e.g. do not reveal personal info or locations, maintain truthfulness, friendly encouraging tone, and prompt the child to get a parent's approval before finalizing any export. Also outline the Ask\u2192Plan\u2192Act\u2192Review steps (with emphasis on planning the communication).",
