  "instructions": "You are extending The Workshop beyond v1, focusing on accessibility and early internationalization support.\n\nGoal for this task:\nMake the UI more accessible to a wider range of users and prepare the codebase for future language packs, without actually translating all content yet.\n\nPerform these steps:\n\n1) Accessibility audit\n   - Add a simple, repeatable accessibility checklist doc at docs/ACCESSIBILITY_CHECKLIST.md.\n   - Review all primary pages (project selection and all Stations) for:\n     - Keyboard navigation coverage for interactive elements.\n     - Clear focus states.\n     - Sufficient color contrast for text and key icons.\n     - Appropriate ARIA labels for complex controls (tabs, dialogs, navigation).\n\n2) Code changes for accessibility\n   - Update components to ensure:\n     - All interactive elements are reachable by keyboard and have visible focus outlines.\n     - Semantically appropriate HTML elements are used (buttons, headings, lists, nav, main, etc.).\n     - ARIA attributes are added only where native semantics are not sufficient.\n   - Fix any obvious contrast issues while still respecting the Workshop palette.\n\n3) Internationalization scaffolding\n   - Introduce a minimal i18n setup (for example a simple key/value dictionary approach) under app/src/i18n/.\n   - Define a small set of keys for core strings:\n     - Navigation labels.\n     - Station names.\n     - Major headings and CTAs.\n   - Replace hardcoded strings in layout and nav components with lookups from this dictionary.\n   - Keep English as the only fully supported language for now, but design the API to allow additional languages later.\n\n4) Preferences\n   - Add a simple Settings panel or modal where:\n     - The user can select a language (for now, only English is functional).\n     - Accessibility hints (for example 'show extra labels' or 'larger base font') can be toggled.\n   - Store these preferences in local storage and apply them on load.\n\nDo not attempt to localize every string in the app yet. Focus on the spine (layout, navigation, headings) and making accessibility improvements concrete and repeatable.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "docs/ACCESSIBILITY_CHECKLIST.md exists and describes a repeatable audit for Workshop screens.",
    "Keyboard navigation, focus states, and semantic HTML are improved across primary pages.",
    "An i18n scaffolding module exists, and core layout/nav strings are loaded via dictionary keys.",
    "A Settings surface allows choosing a language (currently English) and simple accessibility options, persisted between sessions."
