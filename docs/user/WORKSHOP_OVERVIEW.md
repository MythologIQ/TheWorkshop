# Workshop Overview

The Workshop is a friendly, kid-first creative studio powered by AI helpers. It gives children a safe place to dream up stories, build games, explore science experiments, and share what they make—without needing an account or internet connection.

## Stations in the loop

Each project flows through the same stations so creators can try ideas, polish their work, and reflect:

- **Idea** invites kids to sketch out their concept and gather what they need.
- **Build** is where sketches turn into characters, scenes, or rules for a tiny game.
- **Test** lets them play with their creation, spot what works, and fix anything that feels off.
- **Memory** captures proud moments, lessons learned, and what they want to remember.
- **Reflect** encourages them to step back, tag the moments, and celebrate discoveries.
- **Share** is where they describe their story or invention before showing it to others.
- **Replay** is a friendly rewind of their journey so they can see how far they came.

## What families can create

Kids can use The Workshop to make:

- Robot dog comics with bold ideas and funny panels.
- Tiny game concepts with goals, rules, and win conditions.
- Science experiment logs that track what they tried, what happened, and what they learned.
- Stories, songs, podcasts, or inventions that fit their imagination.

Every project stays on the device, so families keep control of their creativity while still getting help from the AI assistant.
