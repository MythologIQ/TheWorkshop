# Educator Guide

The Workshop is a local-first creative studio that lets students explore science, storytelling, art, and engineering without accounts or cloud storage. Here are a few ideas for classroom activities and how to use the Replay, Reflect, and Diagnostics tools.

## Classroom activities

- **Template sprint** – Give each learner a template such as the Robot Dog Comic or Science Experiment Log. Let them customize the idea station entries, test the concept, and share their findings back to the group.
- **Build & test showcase** – Have students work through an idea, build, and test station, then share the unexpected results at a weekly showcase. Use the Reflect station to tag what they learned.
- **Memory journal swap** – After a build/test cycle, students document their proud moments in Memory. Pair them up to read each other’s entries before Replay lets them tell the story again.

## Replay, Reflect, and Diagnostics

- **Replay** helps students see how a project grew. Teachers can use it to highlight persistence or to compare early ideas with final outcomes.
- **Reflect** is a safe space to tag snapshots and describe insights. Prompt students to add tags that capture emotions or breakthroughs, which can help later discussions.
- **Diagnostics** shows anonymized, device-only telemetry counts. It answers questions like “How many stations did students visit?” or “How many projects were started today?” Use it to spot which stations learners enjoy and where they might need more guidance.

## Supporting local-first use

The Workshop runs entirely on the device and does not require internet access. If you want to move projects between devices, use the Export feature to save `.workshop.json` files and Import them on another tablet or classroom computer. Encourage students to ask a facilitator when they want to export or import work.

## Helping learners succeed

Remind students that The Workshop is a co-pilot—not a teacher. Encourage experimentation, celebrating the questions that come up in Build or Test, and using Share to describe discoveries. When they feel stuck, invite them to open the Settings panel together for larger fonts or extra labels so every student can keep playing.
