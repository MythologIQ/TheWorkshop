# MythologIQ Creation Lab Educator Rollout Playbook

## Overview
MythologIQ Creation Lab pairs the Workshop’s station loop with privacy-first behavior, making it ideal for classrooms and small groups. This playbook helps you pilot it in a few structured sessions while leaning on Replay, Adult Insights, and the Safety Contract (`docs/SAFETY_CONTRACT.md`).

## Session plan
- **Session one – Introductions:** Share the MythologIQ Creation Lab story, name the stations (Idea, Build, Test, Memory, Reflect, Share, Replay), and have each student pick or create a profile. Walk through a new project in Idea Station and finish a tiny Build test. Let kids export one small snapshot so they see how the `.workshop.json` format works (`docs/PROJECT_EXPORT_FORMAT.md`).
- **Session two – Looping:** Focus on Build → Test → Memory. Encourage students to try a small experiment, capture what worked in Memory Station, and reflect on their process. Show Replay so they feel comfortable branching without losing work and use Adult Insights to surface the learning loop (`docs/user/EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md`).
- **Ongoing practice:** Rotate through Share and Replay regularly, revisit Idea and Reflect to refresh goals, and encourage exports for showcasing projects to families.

## Profiles, templates, and Replay tips
- Encourage each student to maintain a separate profile so personal work stays organized. Use templates as starting points when you want consistent prompts.
- Replay is the safety net: have students snapshot before major changes, so they can always pull a prior draft back.
- Lean on Adult Insights to monitor which stations students use most and adjust support accordingly.

## Technical readiness checklist
- Devices charged, browsers updated, and the MythologIQ Creation Lab version matches the latest release notes (`docs/RELEASE_READINESS_PROMPT_042.md`).
- LocalStorage cleared if students are sharing devices, so profiles don’t overlap.
- Export/import paths tested once before the session so students can save work when they are ready.
- Diagnostics/Adult Insights visible so you can spot unexpected behavior early.
