# Getting Started (Adults)

This guide explains how to support children using The Workshop, including the loop, settings, telemetry, and project management tools.

## What the Workshop does

The Workshop combines friendly AI prompts with a station-based loop: Idea → Build → Test → Memory → Reflect → Share → Replay. Each station helps kids think, experiment, and describe their work. No login or cloud storage is required—everything stays on the device unless you export a project file.

## Supporting a child without taking over

1. Let the child choose a template or start a blank project from the Project Selection screen.
2. Encourage them to visit each station in order, but remind them it is okay to jump around.
3. Listen to the AI helper together. It only suggests ideas or questions, so you can gently steer without doing the work for them.
4. Use **Replay** to celebrate how the project evolved and **Memory** to capture learning moments.

## Settings, diagnostics, and data

- The **Settings** panel lets the child choose a language (English is unlocked for now) and turn on accessibility helpers such as extra labels or a larger default font.
- Telemetry is stored locally. The Diagnostics page summarizes usage counts, but no data leaves the device. You can reset metrics or disable telemetry entirely from that panel.
- Use the **Import** button to open a `.workshop.json` file or **Export** to save a project backup when you want to share progress.

For deeper detail about how privacy works, see `docs/PRIVACY_NOTES.md`. Safety boundaries and what is allowed are documented in `docs/SAFETY_CONTRACT.md`, so review those before deploying the app in a classroom or shared space.

## Helping without hijacking the creative flow

Focus on asking open-ended questions such as “What happens next?” or “Which station do you want to try?” rather than editing the project yourself. Encourage kids to reflect in the Memory station and celebrate their progress on the Share screen.
