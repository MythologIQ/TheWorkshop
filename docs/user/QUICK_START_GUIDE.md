# MythologIQ Creation Lab Quick Start Guide

## Step-by-step for your first session
1. **Pick or create a profile.** Tap “Continue as a new creator,” pick a name, and decide whether to use a fun avatar. Profiles keep each child’s work organized without needing an account.
2. **Start a new project.** Give it a short title and describe the idea in a sentence. The Workshop launches you inside the MythologIQ Creation Lab automatically once a project exists.
3. **Visit a few stations.** Begin at Idea Station to craft a mission brief, then hop to Build to tackle one small step. Take a quick Test check, add anything you learned to Memory, and reflect before sharing highlights. The MythologIQ Creation Lab loop is Idea → Build → Test → Memory → Reflect → Share → Replay, so keep cycling until you feel ready.
4. **Use Replay.** Open Replay Station to snapshot the project before trying a different direction. Replay lets you bring earlier versions back so you can compare ideas without losing anything.
5. **Export or share when ready.** Share Station builds a kid-friendly story. If you want to move work to another device, export a `.workshop.json` file and import it later (see `docs/PROJECT_EXPORT_FORMAT.md` and `docs/PRIVACY_NOTES.md` for how exports stay on-device until you choose otherwise).

## If you are a kid
- Lean on the station helper tips—keep each task tiny, celebrate what you finish, and ask for a Replay snapshot when you want to save a version.
- When the AI asks a question, answer honestly. It will suggest how to experiment next, not judge you.
- Use the Safety Contract and friendly tone in every station: if the AI says something weird, pause, reset, and ask for a new idea.

## If you are an adult helping
- Start by reviewing `docs/user/WORKSHOP_OVERVIEW.md` so you can describe how the MythologIQ Creation Lab stations map to learning goals.
- Encourage kids to take extra labels or hints from Preferences if they want more context, then let them drive the station flow.
- Keep devices charged, remind families that everything stays on the device, and offer to help export a `.workshop.json` file if they want a backup.
