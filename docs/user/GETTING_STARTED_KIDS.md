# Getting Started (Kids)

Welcome to The Workshop! This guide helps you jump into your next creative adventure in just a few minutes.

## Step 1: Open the workshop

1. Run `npm run dev` from the repo root if you are working on a computer where adults help. On a finished install, open the browser link that the app gives you.
2. When the page loads, you will see the Project Selection screen with cards for templates and your past projects.
3. Choose a template to start with an idea already waiting, or tap *Create blank project* to begin from scratch.

## Step 2: Move between stations

Use the station links or buttons to hop through:

- **Idea** to write what you want to build.
- **Build** to draw or describe the magic you are creating.
- **Test** to pretend you are playing or using what you made, and note what happens.
- **Memory** to jot down proud moments and lessons learned.
- **Reflect** to tag the snapshots that feel important.
- **Share** to describe your favorite parts to friends grown-ups.
- **Replay** to watch your story unfold again.

Every button can be reached with the Tab key and has a bright outline when it is focused, so you always know where you are.

## Step 3: The AI helper

The purple AI helper listens to your ideas and gives gentle suggestions. It does not tell you what to do—it just asks questions like “Can you add more detail?” or “What happens next?” You can ignore the hint if you have a different plan, and it is always okay to ask an adult for help.

## Step 4: Save your work

Your projects stay on this computer. When you go back to the Project Selection screen, you will see your project with a timestamp. Tap it to keep working.

If you want to share or keep a copy, ask an adult how to use the *Export* or *Import* buttons—they work with files that end in `.workshop.json`.

Remember: every idea you try in The Workshop is safe, and there are no wrong answers.
