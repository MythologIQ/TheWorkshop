# MythologIQ Creation Lab FAQ

## Questions kids might ask
- **What happens to my projects?** They stay right on the device and are saved automatically while you move through Idea, Build, Test, Memory, Reflect, Share, and Replay. You can always export a `.workshop.json` file to save a copy or move it to another device.
- **Can I get the same project on another computer?** Yes—export the project file, move it using a USB stick or share it with your parent, then import it on the other device. The file keeps only the creative work and station snapshots (`docs/PROJECT_EXPORT_FORMAT.md` explains the format).
- **What if the AI says something weird or gets stuck?** Ask for a new idea, switch to a different station, or close and reopen the station. MythologIQ Creation Lab’s AI follows the Safety Contract (`docs/SAFETY_CONTRACT.md`) and is designed to reset quickly if something feels off.

## Questions for parents or caregivers
- **Can I move projects between devices?** Yes. Export to `.workshop.json`, move it any way you like, and import it on another MythologIQ Creation Lab install. The Studio keeps everything on-device until you choose to export (`docs/PRIVACY_NOTES.md`).
- **What does telemetry track?** It counts things like station visits, steps completed, and snapshots taken. Telemetry stays in `localStorage`, never leaves the device, and can be reset or cleared from Diagnostics.
- **Is there a login or account?** No accounts, no cloud profiles. Every profile is device-local, so you control who can access each project.
- **What if I worry about privacy?** The Workshop keeps telemetry, projects, and preferences on-device. Only exports or optional diagnostics summaries leave when you choose to share them.

## Questions educators might have
- **How does Replay help class projects?** Replay lets students snapshot progress before trying new directions, so you can see how ideas changed over time and keep multiple drafts without starting over.
- **How do I know if MythologIQ Creation Lab is safe for my group?** The app enforces the Safety Contract across all stations, and Adult Insights lets you spot any odd patterns (`docs/user/EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md` covers this in more detail).
- **Can multiple students work on one device?** Yes—create separate profiles and export/import when you want to move work between tablets. Use Diagnostics and Adult Insights to track who used what stations.
