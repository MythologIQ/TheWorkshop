# MythologIQ Creation Lab Branding

## Identity block
- The `MythologIQ Creation Lab` identity block sits beside the main Workshop logo where final artifacts are presented, reinforcing the creation origin without altering the day-to-day product name.
- The block pairs the brand name with the stamp copy `Created in the MythologIQ Creation Lab`, using the `CreationLabStamp` component so color, spacing, and typography remain consistent across Share, Replay, and template preview surfaces.
- Keep the base logo untouched; the mark panel should feel supportive (light border, centered text) and never dominates the primary Workshop mark.

## Translation keys
- `creationLab.brandName` – `MythologIQ Creation Lab`
- `creationLab.stamp` – `Created in the MythologIQ Creation Lab`
- Use these keys whenever re-rendering the stamp or building future export previews so the text stays localized with the rest of the interface.
