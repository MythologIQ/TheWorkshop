# Process Inspiration

The Workshop's process design is inspired by structured meta prompting systems like TACHES, but all prompts and flows here are original and tailored to kids first learning.

The core principle is to separate:
- Thinking about the work
- Doing the work
- Recording what was done

The Workshop will gradually expose simplified versions of these ideas to children in age appropriate ways.
