# MythologIQ Creation Lab Atlas

## Introduction – A starship for young creators
MythologIQ Creation Lab is imagined as a starship shipyard where each key step of a project happens in a themed Station (room). Kids move station to station to turn an idea into reality, guided by the learning loop: **Ask → Reflect → Plan → Act → Review**. The crew:
- Design Dock (Idea Station)
- Assembly Bay (Build Station)
- Diagnostics Corridor (Test Station)
- Stellar Archive (Memory Station)

## Learning loop and Station mapping
- **Design Dock (Idea Station):** Emphasizes Ask, Reflect, Plan. Draws out the dream, checks excitement/feasibility, and drafts a mission brief plus starter steps.
- **Assembly Bay (Build Station):** Emphasizes Plan, Act, and a bit of Review. Turns the plan into action one small task at a time; celebrates progress with quick check-ins.
- **Diagnostics Corridor (Test Station):** Emphasizes Ask, Act, Review. Prompts simple tests (“What should this do, and does it?”), observes results, and suggests fixes. Frames issues as discoveries.
- **Stellar Archive (Memory Station):** Emphasizes Reflect and Review with a forward Ask. Captures what happened, what worked, what to remember next time; keeps a captain’s log.

## Core terminology
- **Station:** Themed module tied to the learning loop; each has an internal name and a shipyard alias (e.g., Idea Station → Design Dock).
- **Mission brief:** Short, kid-friendly summary of goal, audience, and success picture (created in Design Dock).
- **Starter steps:** 3–5 tiny initial tasks sized for beginners (created in Design Dock).
- **Project lifecycle:** Projects move through Stations, looping Build ↔ Test as needed, then wrap in Memory. Status examples: draft, in_progress, completed.
- **Safety Contract:** Always on. Refuse or redirect unsafe requests; stay kind and honest (see `docs/SAFETY_CONTRACT.md`).

## Sample project journey – “Robot Dog Comic”
- **Design Dock – Shaping the idea:** Child says, “I want to make a comic about a robot dog.” Station asks, “Who is it for? What happens first?” Mission brief: “Robot dog rescues a kite for friends.” Starter steps: 1) Pick the dog’s look, 2) Sketch the kite trouble, 3) Write 4 speech bubbles.
- **Assembly Bay – Building step by step:** Focus on one task: “Let’s do the head first; add one fun feature.” Child draws big goggles; Station celebrates and lines up the next tiny step. Offers options if stuck: break smaller, swap order, or ask for a hint.
- **Diagnostics Corridor – Testing and tinkering:** Checks readability: “Can you follow the panels?” Child notices panels 2 and 3 are mixed up. Station suggests a fix: add an arrow between them; notes the issue as a learning.
- **Assembly Bay – Applying fixes:** Child adds the arrow; Station praises and keeps steps moving. Build/Test loop repeats as needed.
- **Stellar Archive – Reflecting and remembering:** Logs the win (“Panel order fixed; flow is clear.”) and a reminder (“Keep speech bubbles small.”). Creates a captain’s log entry; project can be marked completed or paused. Kids leave feeling proud and ready for next time.
