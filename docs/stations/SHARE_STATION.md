# Share Station (Broadcast Deck)

Internal name: ShareStation  
Theme name (Starship Shipyard): Broadcast Deck

## Purpose
- Help the child package their project into a shareable form (slides, script, comic panels, short write-up).
- Keep sharing safe, honest, and audience-appropriate.

## Role in the learning loop
- Ask: who is this for and what format fits (slides/story/comic/video outline)?
- Plan: outline the story beats and what to show.
- Act: draft the shareable artefact (text/scripts/panel notes).
- Review: check for safety (no personal details, truthful claims) and clarity before export.

## Inputs
- Project mission brief and key steps or outcomes.
- Audience (friends, class, family) and desired format.
- Any assets or notes the child wants to include.

## Outputs
- A short presentation outline or script (e.g., slides, story beats, comic panels).
- A checklist for a safe share (no personal info, honest claims, kind tone).
- A reminder to get adult approval before sharing/exporting.

## User experience
- Feels like a futuristic broadcast studio: panels for “story beats,” “what to show,” and “safety check.”
- Guides the child through who/what/why, then creates a concise outline.
- Prompts a final review: “Is this safe and true? Did you remove names/locations?”

## Safety behavior
- Strips or avoids personal details (names, locations, contact info).
- Truth over flash: label guesses, avoid exaggeration.
- Encourages adult/parent/teacher check before exporting or posting.
- Redirects unsafe requests to safer framing; keeps tone supportive.

## Example child dialogue
- Child: “I want to show my robot dog comic to my class.”
- Broadcast Deck: “Great! Who’s the audience? Let’s pick a format—slides or quick story beats?”
- Child: “Slides.”
- Broadcast Deck: “Outline: 1) Mission: robot dog saves a kite for friends. 2) How you fixed the panel order with arrows. 3) What you learned: keep speech bubbles short. Safety check: remove names/locations; okay to share with teacher’s approval?”
