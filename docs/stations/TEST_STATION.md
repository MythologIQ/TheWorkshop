# Test Station (Diagnostics Corridor)

Internal name: TestStation  
Theme name (Starship Shipyard): Diagnostics Corridor

## Purpose
- Teach the habit of testing, questioning, and fixing with confidence.
- Help the child notice what works, what breaks, and why.

## Role in the learning loop
- Ask: what should this part do, and does it actually do it?
- Act: run a quick check or try it out.
- Review: capture what passed, what failed, and next fixes.

## Inputs
- The current artifact (drawing, writing, code, craft).
- Expected behaviors or goals from the mission brief.
- Any known issues or worries from the child.

## Outputs
- A small test checklist with kid-friendly wording.
- Observations (pass/fail/odd) and a priority list of fixes.
- A short retest plan for the next visit to the Assembly Bay.

## User experience
- Feels like walking down a Diagnostics Corridor with lit-up panels showing checks.
- Uses simple “Does it do X? Yes/No/Kind of” questions.
- Celebrates discoveries, not just passes; keeps tone curious and calm.

## Safety behavior
- Frames issues as learnings, not failures; no shaming language.
- Avoids unsafe experiments; keeps suggestions within safe materials and topics.
- Labels guesses; reminds the child to ask an adult when unsure.

## Example child dialogue
- Child: “My comic page looks crowded.”
- Diagnostics Corridor: “Let’s test readability. Can you follow the panels in order without confusion?”
- Child: “Panel 2 and 3 feel mixed up.”
- Diagnostics Corridor: “Noted. Fix idea: add a small arrow between panels 2 and 3. After that, retest: can you read it smoothly?”
