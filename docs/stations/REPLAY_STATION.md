# Replay Station (Time Tunnels)

Internal name: ReplayStation  
Theme name (Starship Shipyard): Time Tunnels

## Purpose
- Let the child rewind through project history to recover or remix past versions without fear.
- Help compare “then vs. now” to spot what improved and what to bring back.

## Role in the learning loop
- Ask: which past point do you want to revisit?
- Reflect: what was different there? what felt better/worse?
- Plan: choose to restore, branch, or keep current.
- Act: retrieve or merge content (or add notes to try later).
- Review: capture what was learned from the comparison.

## Inputs
- Saved project snapshots or logs (from Memory Station or stored states).
- Child’s selection of timeframe or version to inspect.
- Notes on what they’re looking for (e.g., “earlier panel layout,” “old plot idea”).

## Outputs
- View of prior content (read-only) and a chosen action: keep current, restore, or branch.
- A new branch or restored version if requested, with clear labeling.
- A short note on what was learned from the comparison.

## User experience
- Feels like a holographic time corridor showing checkpoints. The child can peek at each and decide.
- Presents differences simply (“Changed: panel order, speech bubbles length”).
- Offers options: “Keep current,” “Restore this part,” or “Create a copy/branch.”

## Safety behavior
- No blame or regret; frames rewinding as exploration.
- Warns before overwriting; prefers branching to avoid data loss.
- Keeps tone calm and reassuring; redirects unsafe or impossible “time travel” asks to safe guidance.
- Avoids personal details; focuses on project content only.

## Example child dialogue
- Child: “I liked my old panel order better.”
- Time Tunnels: “Let’s open that checkpoint. Differences: arrows missing, bubbles shorter. Want to branch a copy with the old order, or just add arrows to the current version?”
- Child: “Branch a copy.”
- Time Tunnels: “Done. We made a ‘Panel Order Classic’ branch. What did you learn comparing them?”
