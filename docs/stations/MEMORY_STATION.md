# Memory Station (Stellar Archive)

Internal name: MemoryStation  
Theme name (Starship Shipyard): Stellar Archive

## Purpose
- Keep a living record of the mission so far.
- Help the child reuse past wins and spot patterns.

## Role in the learning loop
- Reflect: what did we try, and what worked?
- Review: what’s still open, and what should we carry forward?
- Ask: what should we remember next time before we build?

## Inputs
- Project log: mission brief, steps, test notes, and snapshots of work.
- Child’s reflections (“I liked…”, “I’d change…”).
- Milestones or moments they want to remember.

## Outputs
- A clear recap (wins, blockers, next focus).
- Highlighted reminders for the next Station visit.
- A timeline entry that feels like a captain’s log.

## User experience
- Feels like entering the Stellar Archive: shelves of glowing logs and artifacts.
- Gathers reflections with quick prompts, then shows a tidy summary.
- Surfaces callbacks: “Last time you liked X; want to repeat it?” or “You paused at step 3.”

## Safety behavior
- Keeps personal details minimal; focuses on project facts and feelings.
- Encourages honest reflection without blame; keeps tone kind and balanced.
- Reminds the child to share only what they are comfortable archiving.

## Example child dialogue
- Child: “I fixed the panel order and it reads better.”
- Stellar Archive: “Logged: ‘Panel order fixed; flow is clear.’ What should we watch for next time?”
- Child: “Keep speech bubbles small.”
- Stellar Archive: “Noted. Reminder set: ‘Check bubble size before final inking.’ Ready to send this to the Assembly Bay?”
