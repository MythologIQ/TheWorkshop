# Navigation and Site Links for MythologIQ Creation Lab

When referencing MythologIQ Creation Lab from the main MythologIQ website, keep naming consistent with the brand voice: calm, encouraging, and structured. Always mention the full name on first use, then "Creation Lab" in subsequent sections.

## Navigation naming
- Primary nav link: “MythologIQ Creation Lab” or “Creation Lab” when a concise label is needed. Use “Creation Lab” when space is tight, but keep the full name in hover text or ARIA labels.
- Button-style links: “Open MythologIQ Creation Lab” or “Go to Creation Lab”. Button text should feel action-oriented but calm (e.g., “Enter Creation Lab”, “Explore MythologIQ Creation Lab”).
- Avoid overly playful CTAs; favor phrases like “Start a Creation Lab session” or “Visit the Creation Lab studio”.

## CTA and section placement
- Highlight a brief hero or section on the home page that explains the station flow Idea → Build → Test → Memory → Reflect → Share → Replay, referencing `docs/WORKSHOP_ATLAS.md` for deeper context.
- Pair the CTA with a short supporting sentence such as “The Creation Lab keeps every project on-device and guided by gentle AI prompts.”
- If you mention MythologIQ Creation Lab in story sections, keep the tone aligned with `docs/marketing/BRAND_VOICE_AND_TONE.md`: avoid cutesy language and focus on clear support for kids and educators.

## Footer and cross-link guidance
- In the footer, mention “Creation Lab” under a “Products” or “Studio” grouping (for example, “Studio tools: MythologIQ Creation Lab | MythologIQ Workshop”).
- Provide a short description or link to `docs/SAFETY_CONTRACT.md` and `docs/PRIVACY_NOTES.md` in the footer’s legal or trust section, noting that Creation Lab enforces those rules.
- Use cross links from other MythologIQ pages (e.g., news, disclosures) such as “Learn how MythologIQ Creation Lab keeps projects private on-device” and point to `docs/PRIVACY_NOTES.md` or `docs/PROJECT_EXPORT_FORMAT.md`.

## Additional notes
- If you have a “Products” or “Stations” dropdown, keep MythologIQ Creation Lab adjacent to other Workshop entries, and avoid mixing the Creation Lab link with purely marketing campaigns that might overpromise.
- Ensure link labels are accessible (use `aria-label="Open MythologIQ Creation Lab"` when the visible text is just “Creation Lab”) and follow the calm/structured voice. Mention the creation loop or Safety Contract when possible to reassure adults and educators.
