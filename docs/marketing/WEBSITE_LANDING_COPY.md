# Website Landing Copy for MythologIQ Creation Lab

## Hero
**Headline:** MythologIQ Creation Lab - a calm, station-based studio for curious kids.  
**Subheadline:** Guided by the Workshop loop, every project moves through Idea, Build, Test, Memory, Reflect, Share, and Replay so adults can trust the journey and kids stay in control.

## Key benefits
- **Station-smooth focus:** The Studio organizes creative work into Idea, Build, Test, Memory, Reflect, Share, and Replay stations so every child knows what to do next without feeling lost.
- **Patient AI prompts:** The assistant asks friendly questions, celebrates small wins, and encourages reflection without rushing or judging, drawing on the Safety Contract instead of pressure.
- **Share and Replay without resetting:** Capture proud moments in Share Station, then return to earlier snapshots in Replay to see how ideas evolved before exporting a `.workshop.json` story.
- **Device-first privacy and control:** Projects, telemetry, and preferences stay on each device, and families choose when to export work, just as described in `docs/PRIVACY_NOTES.md`.

## Safety and privacy highlight
MythologIQ Creation Lab follows the Safety Contract (`docs/SAFETY_CONTRACT.md`), keeps every signal on-device, and never requires accounts or cloud sign-ins. You can reset telemetry or keep it private, and exports include only the creative content families choose to share.
