**Subject:** Introducing MythologIQ Creation Lab - the Workshop's new storytelling studio

Hi [Name],

We just finished crafting the MythologIQ Creation Lab, a calm, station-based studio that helps kids move from Idea to Share with gentle AI prompts and clear checkpoints. The Studio follows the same learning loop educators trust (Idea → Build → Test → Memory → Reflect → Share → Replay), keeps every project on the device, and never asks families for a login. When creators are ready, they can export a `.workshop.json` story to save, share, or continue elsewhere.

This update is part of our ongoing MythologIQ mission: build safe, kid-friendly tools that respect privacy and celebrate curiosity. We would love your feedback and would be happy to walk you through the Stations or the Safety Contract anytime.

Warmly,  
[Your Name] on behalf of the MythologIQ team

MythologIQ Creation Lab is live - a device-first studio where young creators move through Idea, Build, Test, Memory, Reflect, Share, and Replay with calm AI guidance and built-in safety. No accounts, no cloud data, just the same privacy-forward Workshop we have always stood behind. Ready to introduce it to your classroom or family? See how it links back to the MythologIQ mission of safe, curiosity-driven AI.
