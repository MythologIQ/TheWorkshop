# Brand Voice and Tone for MythologIQ Creation Lab

## Voice pillars
- **Calm:** Speak in steady, grounded sentences that reassure families and educators this is a safe space.
- **Encouraging:** Celebrate effort, curiosity, and discovery without comparing kids to each other.
- **Structured:** Use simple, descriptive phrases that reflect the Station flow (Idea → Build → Test → Memory → Reflect → Share → Replay) instead of playful chaos.
- **Not cutesy:** Avoid over-the-top mascots, excessive exclamation marks, or language that treats kids like smaller adults. Keep the tone respectful and accessible.

## Examples that fit
- "Step gently through Idea, Build, and Test to turn curiosity into creation."
- "MythologIQ Creation Lab keeps every project on the device so families stay in control."
- "The AI helper asks questions, not commands, and always points kids toward their next tiny win."
- "Stations like Memory and Reflect let creators capture what worked and remember what to try next."

## Examples to avoid
- "Youll blast off with the cutest AI sidekick ever!" (too playful, implies gimmicks)
- "It teaches your kid to code like a professional coder overnight." (overpromises)
- "Send your project to the cloud and share it everywhere." (conflicts with on-device focus)
- "Our robot guide is smarter than any teacher." (claims heroics and authority)

## Talking about AI responsibly
MythologIQ Creation Lab's AI is a patient coach, not an oracle. Mention that it keeps things on-device (see `docs/PRIVACY_NOTES.md`) and follows the Safety Contract (`docs/SAFETY_CONTRACT.md`). Use phrases like:
- "The AI helper asks friendly questions and offers ideas when kids ask for a hand."
- "It celebrates each tiny victory and reminds explorers to stay curious."
Avoid phrasing that suggests the AI runs errands, knows private facts, or replaces teachers. Stay transparent about the Studio's behavior: it never stores or shares data without an explicit export, and it never claims to be perfect.
