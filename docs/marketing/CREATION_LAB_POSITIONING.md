# MythologIQ Creation Lab Positioning

## What it is
MythologIQ Creation Lab is the Workshop's friendly, kid-first creative studio. It wraps the stations, learning loop, and AI helpers from `The Workshop Atlas` into a single story: kids imagine at Idea, build at Build, test at Test, capture wins in Memory, reflect on what they learned, share their favorite moments, and revisit progress in Replay. The whole journey feels like piloting a space-age studio where every station nudges learners forward without overwhelming them.

## The Station journey
- **Idea Station:** Sketch a mission brief, dream up who the story is for, and pick the tiniest next steps.
- **Build Station:** Tackle one bite-sized task at a time, keep momentum with gentle check-ins, and stay flexible when a new idea pops up.
- **Test Station:** Ask "What should this do?" then try it, notice what worked, and treat surprises as discoveries.
- **Memory Station:** Capture the win (what worked) and the lesson (what to try next) so nothing slips away.
- **Reflect Station:** Talk through how the day felt, what helped, and what to celebrate before moving on.
- **Share Station:** Package highlights for friends, mentors, or classrooms without pressure.
- **Replay Station:** Bring past snapshots back to life so kids can see how ideas grow.

## For kids
MythologIQ Creation Lab speaks directly to curious young creators. Each Station keeps instructions short, the tone encouraging, and the prompts structured so that even a wobbly start feels manageable. Kids can experiment, checkpoint progress, and circle back anytime - no reset button is needed, just a friendly nudge to take the next small step.

## For parents and caregivers
Creation Lab works without accounts, logins, or cloud profiles. Everything, from projects to telemetry counts, lives on the device unless you explicitly export a `.workshop.json` file, so families keep control of their creativity. You can watch the station progress, open the Diagnostics Panel to see how many stations were visited, and reassure kids that the AI assistant is always kind, never shaming, and never pretending to be a judge.

## For educators
MythologIQ Creation Lab is built for classroom or after-school settings where devices are shared and focused time matters. Stations mirror the learning loop that educators already trust (ask, reflect, plan, act, review) and make it easy to loop between Build and Test before capturing reflections in Memory. Educators can verify behavior in the Safety Contract and keep telemetry on-device through the Diagnostics panel, then optionally export a project to share with families.

## Privacy and safety
The Creation Lab follows the Safety Contract rules: no unsafe content, no personal data leakage, and a calm, encouraging tone at all times. All telemetry and project data stay on the device, and exports honor the rules described in `docs/PROJECT_EXPORT_FORMAT.md` and `docs/PRIVACY_NOTES.md`. The AI assistant never claims to be infallible - it teases out ideas, celebrates discovery, and points kids toward trusted adults when things get tricky.
