      "description": "Create the Time Tunnels system prompt file for the Replay Station persona. In this prompt, explain that the station can travel through the project's timeline to retrieve past ideas. Include guidelines from the Safety Contract: maintain a calm, reassuring tone (so the child doesn\u2019t feel bad about backtracking), avoid any blame for past mistakes, and redirect any unsafe or impossible \"time travel\" requests gently. The prompt should outline the station\u2019s process (confirm the time range, display prior content, and offer next steps).",

Add \"replay\" to the StationKey enum definition and update related structures so that Time Tunnels is recognized as a station with its own state.
