  "phase": "UI Bridge: Layout and Navigation",
  "title": "Implement Global Layout, Station Chrome, and Navigation Shell",
  "summary": "Replace placeholder UI with real Workshop chroming, station-aware navigation, and a responsive shell that wraps all stations.",
  "instructions": "You must follow the design language and metaphors in WORKSHOP_ATLAS.MD (starship shipyard, Stations, calm workshop feel).\n\nGoal for this task:\nBuild the global layout, navigation shell, and Station chrome so that all Stations live inside a consistent, kid-friendly interface.\n\nPerform these steps:\n\n1) Layout components\n   - Create a folder: app/src/ui/layout/\n   - Implement components:\n     - ShellLayout.tsx: top-level frame with header, side navigation, and content area.\n     - StationNav.tsx: vertical or horizontal navigation showing all Stations.\n     - TopBar.tsx: shows current project name, active Station, and a simple status area.\n     - BackgroundCanvas.tsx: optional background layer that can render the hangar/starfield visual.\n\n2) Station navigation\n   - StationNav must show entries (with icons if available) for:\n     - Idea (Design Dock)\n     - Build (Assembly Bay)\n     - Test (Diagnostics Corridor)\n     - Memory (Stellar Archive)\n     - Reflect (Orbiter Bridge)\n     - Share (Broadcast Deck)\n     - Replay (Time Tunnels)\n   - Use a shared station registry (for example app/src/domain/stations.ts) so routes, labels, and icons all come from the same source.\n   - Make sure the navigation is accessible: focusable, screen-reader friendly, and clearly highlights the active station.\n\n3) Routing integration\n   - Connect StationNav to the router:\n     - Each Station should have a route such as /station/idea, /station/build, etc.\n     - Clicking a nav item updates both the URL and the current activeStation in uiStore (or equivalent).\n   - Ensure that when the app loads without a project selected, the shell either:\n     - Redirects to the ProjectSelectionPage, or\n     - Shows a gentle gate message and a button to choose a project.\n\n4) Visual style\n   - Use Tailwind and Radix/Shadcn components where they exist.\n   - Match the Workshop themes:\n     - Calm blues and violets, soft shapes, generous padding.\n     - Clear hierarchy: Stations on the side, content center, global header on top.\n   - Make sure the layout responds sensibly to smaller viewports.\n\n5) Remove placeholder screens\n   - Replace any placeholder 'Coming soon' divs or bare text with the real layout components, even if the inner Station content is still minimal.\n   - Keep Station pages as distinct components that are rendered inside ShellLayout.\n\nDo not implement deep Station logic here. Focus on the shell, navigation, and a coherent look and feel.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "ShellLayout, StationNav, TopBar, and (optional) BackgroundCanvas components exist under app/src/ui/layout/.",
    "All Stations are listed in a central registry and rendered in StationNav with correct labels and icons (where assets exist).",
    "Router and uiStore remain in sync for the active Station and routes like /station/idea work.",
    "The app uses a consistent visual shell aligned with Workshop themes, with no placeholder-only pages remaining.",
    "The layout behaves reasonably on smaller screens and exposes keyboard-focusable navigation."
