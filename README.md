# The Workshop

The Workshop is a kids first creative studio that teaches how to build things step by step with the help of AI.

It is not a code editor and not a full developer environment.  
Its primary purpose is to help children (and curious beginners) learn how to:

- Shape ideas  
- Break ideas into steps  
- Test and question their creations  
- Keep track of their projects over time  

This repo will contain the design documents, prompts, and architecture for The Workshop.
