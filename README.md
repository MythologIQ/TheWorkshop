# The Workshop

The Workshop is a kids first creative studio that helps children and curious beginners turn ideas into real projects with the help of AI.

This repository contains:
- Design documents and specs (in `docs/`)
- System and role prompts (in `prompts/`)
- UI flows and wireframes (in `ui/`)
- Application code (in `app/`)
- Operations and environment notes (in `ops/`)
- Roadmap and change history (in `roadmap/`)

The Workshop is separate from Hearthlink. Hearthlink is a professional tool for orchestrating agents. The Workshop is a teaching and exploration space designed for kids first.
