  "summary": "Define offline/PWA build profiles and deployment guide for local or limited-connectivity environments.",
  "instructions": "You are preparing The Workshop for distribution in environments where internet access may be limited or tightly controlled.\n\nGoal for this task:\nDefine build outputs and documentation that support offline use, whether served from a local network or installed as a PWA/packaged app.\n\nPerform these steps:\n\n1) Build profiles\n   - Update build configuration (Vite and package.json scripts) to create at least:\n     - A standard web build.\n     - An offline-focused build profile (for example with a Service Worker or PWA manifest).\n\n2) PWA / offline support\n   - Add a simple manifest.json and, if appropriate, a Service Worker that:\n     - Caches the core application shell and static assets (JS, CSS, icons, backgrounds).\n     - Does not attempt to cache model binaries beyond what WebLLM already manages.\n\n3) Hosting and install docs\n   - Create docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md describing:\n     - How to run The Workshop on a local machine (npm scripts).\n     - How to host a static build on a local network or intranet server.\n     - How to install it as a PWA in browsers that support it.\n\n4) Safety in offline mode\n   - Confirm that offline usage does not bypass SafetyContract enforcement or model constraints.\n   - Note any differences or limitations in offline mode in the deployment guide.\n\n5) Build verification\n   - Add a simple checklist to DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for verifying a build:\n     - App loads without network once cached.\n     - WebLLM model can still be loaded from local asset paths.\n\nDo not implement native desktop packaging in this task; focus on robust web/PWA-style offline usage.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Build scripts support both standard and offline/PWA-oriented outputs.",
    "A manifest and optional Service Worker exist to support caching the app shell.",
    "DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md describes local, network-hosted, and PWA-style usage.",
    "Safety behavior remains identical in offline-friendly builds."
